# Data Analysis projects

Set of real world data analysis/science tasks gathered from multiple resources like follow along youtube videos, competitions from ScrataScratch and Kaggle, questions from InterviewQs, etc.

I am using these projects to get hands on experience and test what I have learned from multiple resources. The goal is not just to gain knowledge but being able to perform proficiently with what I have learned.

I am also using this to show employers I have worked with real world examples of data and can use skills like Python/Pandas, SQL, and Tableau (want to learn R soon as well) that would be asked of me in an Entry Level position
