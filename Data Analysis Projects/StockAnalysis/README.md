This section will be where I do analysis on certain stocks/etfs that I am interested in and/or looking to invest in to see how to optimize profit. 

I initially tested VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) and can basically use the methods created there for all future stocks and just change the data's imported file name.
