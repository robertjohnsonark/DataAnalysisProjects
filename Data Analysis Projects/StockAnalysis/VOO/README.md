-----------------Inspired by a video from Shashank again. The price data was pulled from Yahoo Finance's historical data of VOO.------------------

This project tests the best days to invest in the stock VOO (index fund of the S&P 500). The backtester method checks which day was the best if you invested $750 on the same weekday everytime.

I also added a method which checks which day is the best to invest if you were to buy that day and sell the next available day.

I also went deeper and allowed for testing for all time data, last 5 years, last year and last 6 months for a deeper analysis into the stock.

The results for VOO:
Friday proved to be the best day to put in money every week and let it accumulate (long term investment)

Tuesday proved to be the best day to put in money and sell the next day (more of a daytrader option)
