# Data Analysis projects

Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

I am using these projects to get hands on experience and test what I have learned from multiple resources. The goal is not just to gain knowledge but be proficient.

I am also using this to show employers I have worked with real world examples of data and can use skills like Python/Pandas, SQL, and Tableau (want to learn R soon as well) that would be asked of me in an Entry Level position
