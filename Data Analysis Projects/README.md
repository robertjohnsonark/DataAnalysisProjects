# Data Analysis projects

Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.
I am using this video, the data given, and the tasks given to help test the Data Analysis skills (Python/Pandas) I have learned recently.
I am also using this to show employers I have worked with real world examples of data and can use skills like Python and Pandas that would be asked of me in an Entry Level position
